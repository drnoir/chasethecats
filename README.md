## Experiment with A-Frame by Chris Godber
Funny little experiment with A-Frame and randomness, building on CubeGen project I wanted to create something a bit more
zany and to experiment somewhat more with environment generation. 

In this project mountains and trees are generated, and a random number of cats (up to 40) which the player then has to catch.

This was made for fun, feel free to fork, build on it, look at it, poke around etc etc

Might work on it again sometime but as I said weird little experiment. It could certainly be made more of a 'game'

## Controls 
* WASD - Move
* Mouse - Look around

## Libraries / Dependencies
* A-Frame
* A-Frame Extras
* A-Frame Physics System
* A-Frame Mountains Component
* A-Frame Simple Sun Sky

Game logic etc is contained in main.js, everything else is just minified js for each dependency
